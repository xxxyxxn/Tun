def check_feasibility(prob_info, solution):
    """
    Check if the given solution is feasible for the problem described by `prob_info`.
    This function validates the feasibility of a solution by checking the following:
    - The solution contains valid routes for all ports.
    - Routes adhere to constraints such as node indices, edge validity, and being simple.
    - Loading, unloading, and rehandling operations are performed correctly.
    - Demand requirements are satisfied at each port.
    Parameters:
    -----------
    prob_info : dict
        A dictionary containing problem information with the following keys: (there may be more keys that are not used)
        - 'N' (int): Number of nodes. (including the gate node)
        - 'E' (list of tuples): List of valid undirected edges in the graph.
        - 'K' (list of tuples): List of demands, where each demand is represented as ((origin, destination), quantity).
        - 'P' (int): Number of ports.
        - 'F' (int): Fixed cost for each route.
        - 'LB' (float): Lower bound for the objective value.
    solution : dict
        A dictionary where keys are port indices (0 to P-1) and values are lists of routes.
        Each route is represented as a tuple (route, demand_index), where:
        - `route` is a list of node indices.
        - `demand_index` is the index of the demand being handled.
    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'feasible' (bool): True if the solution is feasible, False otherwise.
        - 'obj' (float, optional): The total objective value of the solution (only if feasible).
        - 'infeasibility' (list, optional): A list of strings describing reasons for infeasibility (only if not feasible).
        - 'solution' (dict): The input solution.
    Notes:
    ------
    - A route is considered valid if it satisfies the following:
      - It has at least two nodes.
      - All nodes in the route are within valid indices.
      - The route is simple (no repeated nodes).
      - All edges in the route exist in the graph.
    - Demand-node allocations are tracked to ensure no conflicts during loading, unloading, or rehandling.
    - The function checks that all demands are correctly loaded/unloaded at the appropriate ports.
